# Write a Python function that checks whether a word or phrase is `palindrome` or not. Note: A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower().replace(" ", "")
    return s == s[::-1]

word = input("Enter a word: ")
print("Palindrome:", is_palindrome(word))
