# 2. Define a class named `Shape` and its subclass `Square`.
# The `Square` class has an `init` function which takes a `length` as argument.
# Both classes have a `area` function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

        self.length = length
        self.area_value = length ** 2
