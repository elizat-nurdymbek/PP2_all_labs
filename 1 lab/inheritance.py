# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()
# John Doe

# To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:
class Student(Person):
  pass

# Note: Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or methods to the class

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  pass

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()
# Mike Olsen

# So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.
# We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).
# Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    #add properties etc.
    
# When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the parent's __init__() function.

# Note: The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function.

# To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call to the parent's __init__() function:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()
# Mike OLsen

# Now we have successfully added the __init__() function, and kept the inheritance of the parent class, and we are ready to add functionality in the __init__() function.

# Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()
# Mike OLsen

# By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element, it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = 2019

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
print(x.graduationyear)
# 2019

# In the example below, the year 2019 should be a variable, and passed into the Student class when creating student objects. To do so, add another parameter in the __init__() function:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2019)
print(x.graduationyear)
# 2019

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)

x = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2024)
x.welcome()
# Welcome Mike Olsen to the class of 2024
