#A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
# A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
# lambda arguments : expression

# Add 10 to argument a, and return the result:
x = lambda a: a + 10
print(x(5))
# 15

# Multiply argument a with argument b and return the result:
x = lambda a, b: a * b
print(x(5, 6))
# 30

x = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
print(x(5, 6, 2))
# 13

# The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.
# Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:
def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n

# Use that function definition to make a function that always doubles the number you send in:
def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n
mydoubler = myfunc(2)
print(mydoubler(11))
# 22

# Or, use the same function definition to make a function that always triples the number you send in:
def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n
mytripler = myfunc(3)
print(mytripler(11))
# 33

# Or, use the same function definition to make both functions, in the same program:
def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n

mydoubler = myfunc(2)
mytripler = myfunc(3)

print(mydoubler(11)) 
print(mytripler(11))
# 22
# 33

# Use lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.
